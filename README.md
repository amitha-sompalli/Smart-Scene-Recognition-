# Smart Scene Recognition
Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing defining a context for object recognition. Using convolutional neural network (CNN), we learn deep scene features for scene recognition tasks.

## Introduction
Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing defining a context for object recognition. Here we introduce a new scene-centric database with 365 scene categories and 2.5 millions of images with a category label  where there are at most 5000 images per category. Using convolutional neural network (CNN), we learn deep scene features for scene recognition tasks .
